This is a test to indicate the proof of changes pulled and combined branch having proof of request for merging for UECS2363 Assignment 2.
This is a guide on managing a central repository. 

Step 1: Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine. 
1. Navigate to https://github.com/Unleash/unleash. 
2. Click on the ‘Fork’ button to create a copy of the repository. 
3. Copy the repository URL. First, since some files in the repository have paths that exceed the maximum path length limit in Windows, we must use “git config --system core.longpaths true” to allow for smooth copy. Then, open the command prompt and run the clone command. Replace ‘your-name’ with your own Github username. 
$ git config --system core.longpaths true 
$ git clone https://github.com/your-name/unleash.git 

4. Navigate to the cloned directory. 
$ cd unleash 

Step 2. Create new branches 
1. Create and switch to a new branch. We will be naming it the branch ‘test’. 
$ git branch test 
$ git add . 
$ git checkout test 


2. Check the current branch. 
$ git branch

3. Check Current Remote and Change the URL for ‘origin’. 
$ git remote -v 
$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Unleash/unleash.git

Step 3. Make changes and commit. 
1.  Create txt file and put ‘info’ in it. ‘info’ is random sentences. 
$ echo ‘info’ > test1.txt 

2. Add files to the staging area and commit the changes. 
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "Added txt file" 

Step 4. Push changes to GitHub 
1. Push the branch and verify the push in Github. 
$ git push origin test 

Step 5. Integrating changes from different users 
1. Add the original repository as a remote. 
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Unleash/unleash.git 

2. Fetch the latest changes. 
$ git fetch upstream 

3. Merge the updates into your branch.
$ git merge upstream/test 

4. Resolves conflict and commit the changes 
$ git add resolved-file.js $ git commit -m "Resolved conflicts" 

5. Push the merged branch. 
$ git push origin test
